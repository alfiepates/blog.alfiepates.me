So, I'm writing this a few months in the future (March 7th, to be exact) but since this was my first gig at this particular venue, I thought it was worth documenting for future reference, especially as the first "gig log" post on this blog.

Desk was a baby 16ch LX7ii, PA was the venue's homebrew DIY system which worked surprisingly well. I'll have to grab some photos of it next time I'm there, because it is a sight to behold.

The gig was fairly uneventful beyond some wonderfully fun pre-show monitor troubleshooting and the discovery that the headlining bassist's Korg Pitchblack Pro doesn't pass audio when not powered on, which caused two bass dropouts during some of the opening artists. Oh well.
