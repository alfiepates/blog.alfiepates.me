I could put up with your threats, your insults, your ignorance. I didn't like it, but I could put up with it. 

I could avoid waisting my time on your anger, your hatred, your greed. I could ignore your lust to be on top, to be in control. 

I could spend my time caring for my friends, my peers, my loved ones... safe in the knowledge that as long as I loved them, the world would keep turning, and one day your opinions would be left behind. 

I could... Until today.

**I've had enough.**

Fifty one people. Fifty one individuals, each with a name, and a life. Each with a past, and a future. 

Each with hopes and dreams, each with memories, each with loved ones and lost ones, each a unique and wonderful human being.

----

You killed these people.

Your inability to keep your nose out of other's business killed these people.

Your cheap jokes, your dissaproval, your greed, your selfishness killed these people.

Your lack of empathy, your lack of generosity, your lack of humanity killed these people.

Fifty one times, you pulled the trigger.

**No more.**
