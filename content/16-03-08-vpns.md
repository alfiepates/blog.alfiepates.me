If you're active in `#DataHoarder` on Freenode, you've probably heard me say something to the effect of "VPNs are dumb, don't use them." Since I'm fed up of repeating myself, I decided to just write a post explaining my feelings on VPN services, especially those advertised for 'anonymity' or 'privacy', and then provide some better alternatives. If you're in a hurry, skip to the bottom.

_If I've linked you here, that was probably the reason. Also, this post only applies to using third-party VPN services like Private Internet Access._

In short: Don't use them.

You are no more anonymous using a VPN than you are natively connecting to the internet. Your VPN provider can see everything you're doing. A lot of providers claim not to store any logs, but this is both inaccurate and impossible for you to verify. Any malicious (or plain incompetent) VPN provider (and trust me, they exist: See [HideMyAss][1], [Hola][2]) is going to claim they aren't logging just the same as a provider acting in good faith, and there's no way for you to determine the difference. Therefore, it is only safe if you assume every VPN provider logs.

In fact, you're not really anonymous at all using the internet; There are plenty of methods to identify you that don't rely on your IP address, ranging from [tracking cookies and your browser fingerprint][3] to simply the way you behave online. Hell, [even Tor struggles to maintain anonymity at times][4].

A lot of people use VPNs in a misguided attempt to "encrypt their traffic". While a VPN will provide encryption between you and the VPN provider, the provider can still read all the traffic on that connection that isn't encrypted using HTTPS.

There is also the misconception that if you're paying using bitcoin (or something similar), the account can't be traced back to you. This is again inaccurate, since the provider can log the IP you're currently connecting from and any plaintext traffic on the connection.

There is only really one use case for using a VPN for 'security', and that is the following: safely connecting to the internet on a network that you know to be hostile (for instance, public WiFi in a hotel or coffee shop). If that is the case, I'd suggest you set up your own using [this wonderful script][5] and a cheap VPS. I shan't make any recommendations as to a VPS provider, so be sure to check [lowendbox][6].

## TL;DR: Don't use VPN services, do this instead:

1. To avoid tracking by advertisers, install the EFF's [Privacy Badger][7] extension, which is designed to prevent third-party trackers.
2. To encrypt your connections, install [HTTPS Everywhere][8]. This will force an encrypted HTTPS connection on a [growing list of sites][9], and optionally prevent unencrypted HTTP connections altogether.
3. If you still really need a VPN (and you understand the caveats), use [this script][5] and set it up on a server you control.
